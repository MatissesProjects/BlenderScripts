A basic script to help swivel across the axises.

To activate you need to run the script.
Once the script has been run you can get to it in the search menu.

Currently the activation is called `object.simple_movement_operator`

once you activate it use the `E` button to activate the move, then click to accept, then `E` again to go to next after accepting the current move.

Hit escape or right click to exit the move mode.


This is a work in progress, once this work in its basic mode a hotkey can be assigned to make it easier to access and start.
