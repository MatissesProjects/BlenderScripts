A set of scripts written for blender, usually by request

Saving these here so I can refer people to them if they have similar questions.

# Count number of nodes in all materials
A short script that will count all nodes for all materials.

This requires you to have access to the concole, so if starting a new blender window open from terminal will work, or if on Windows you can go to window and show console to see the results.

To run this go to the script tab and append this script, run it, and go to the console for results.

Results should looks something like

```
for Material the total nodes used are 16
for Material.001 the total nodes used are 12
```


# Change swivel axis logic
A basic script to help swivel across the axises.

To activate you need to run the script.
Once the script has been run you can get to it in the search menu.

Currently the activation is called `object.simple_movement_operator`

once you activate it use the `E` button to activate the move, then click to accept, then `E` again to go to next after accepting the current move.

Hit escape or right click to exit the move mode.


This is a work in progress, once this work in its basic mode a hotkey can be assigned to make it easier to access and start.
